#Who deleted my VM ?

#You can connect to any CVM on the cluster and check the acropolis log


#This command gives you the name of the VM deleted:
allssh ‘grep VMDeleAudit /home/nutanix/data/logs/acropolis.out*’


#To determine which user deleted this VM, check the ecli task list on any CVM and get the parent task UUID of a task with Type kVmDelete.
ecli task.list

[copy the task UUID from the above command output]

#With the below command you will get more information about the task and especially the request context where you find the user_ip and user_name.
ecli task.get task UUID
